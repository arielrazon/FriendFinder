# FriendFinder


## What is FriendFinder

FriendFinder is an express and node-based webapp that allows users to find friends in their area based on their answers to a list of questions. 

The app utilizes the Express and Path NPM modules.

## Usage

1. User will reach home page when accessing the website root. 
2. The home page will have a button to begin the survey, see the GitHub Repo, or see the current Friends array.
3. If the user clicks on 'begin survey' button they will be asked to answer 10 questions.
4. When user presses submit, a modal will pop up that will show the user their match! and their information will be sent to the server.
